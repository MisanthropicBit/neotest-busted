REQUIREMENTS                                     *neotest-busted-requirements*

- Neovim 0.9.0+ for the |`-l`| option.
- Neotest <https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest> 4.0.0+ (which requires neovim 0.9.0+).

CONFIGURATION                                   *neotest-busted-configuration*

Setup with neotest. Leave values as `nil` to leave them unspecified.

>lua
    require("neotest").setup({
        adapters = {
            require("neotest-busted")({
                -- Leave as nil to let neotest-busted automatically find busted
                busted_command = "<path to a busted executable>",
                -- Do not use nvim to run busted, but run busted directly
                no_nvim = false,
                -- Extra arguments to busted
                busted_args = { "--shuffle-files" },
                -- List of paths to add to lua path lookups before running
                -- busted, or a function returning a list of such paths
                busted_paths = { "my/custom/path/?.lua" },
                -- List of paths to add to lua cpath lookups before running
                -- busted, or a function returning a list of such paths
                busted_cpaths = { "my/custom/path/?.so" },
                -- Custom config to load via -u to set up testing.
                -- If nil, will look for a 'minimal_init.lua' file
                minimal_init = "custom_init.lua",
                -- Only use a luarocks installation in the project's directory. If
                -- true, installations in $HOME and global installations will be
                -- ignored. Useful for isolating the test environment
                local_luarocks_only = true,
                -- Find parametric tests
                parametric_test_discovery = false,
            }),
        },
    })

DEFINING TESTS                                 *neotest-busted-defining-tests*

Please refer to the official busted documentation
<https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/>.


ASYNC TESTS ~

`neotest-busted` supports `nvim-nio` <https://github.com/nvim-neotest/nvim-nio>
asynchronous tests. You can set `PLENARY_TEST_TIMEOUT` to a numerical value to
control async timeouts.

>lua
    local control = require("neotest.async").control
    local async = require("nio.tests")
    
    describe("async", function()
        before_each(function()
            vim.print("before_each")
        end)
    
        async.it("async test", function()
            local timer = vim.loop.new_timer()
            local event = control.event()
    
            -- Print a message after 2 seconds
            timer:start(2000, 0, function()
                timer:stop()
                timer:close()
                vim.print("Hello from async test")
                event.set()
            end)
    
            -- Wait for the timer to complete
            event.wait()
        end)
    end)
<

If you are not using `nvim-nio`, `neotest-butsed` also comes with builtin
support for async tests. Just use `require("neotest-busted.async")` instead of
`require("nio.tests")` then wrap the test function in a call to `async`. This
also works for `before_each` and `after_each`.

>lua
    local async = require("neotest-busted.async")
    local control = require("neotest.async").control
    
    describe("async", function()
        before_each(async(function()
            vim.print("async before_each")
        end))
    
        it("async test", async(function()
            -- Same as above
        end))
    end)
<

The `async` function takes an optional second timeout argument in milliseconds.
If omitted, uses the numerical value of either the
`NEOTEST_BUSTED_ASYNC_TEST_TIMEOUT` or `PLENARY_TEST_TIMEOUT` environment
variables (in that order) or a default timeout of 2000 milliseconds.


PARAMETRIC TESTS ~


  [!IMPORTANT] Supporting parametric tests requires extra computation to discover
  them so support is disabled by default. You need to set
  `parametric_test_discovery` to `true` if you want neotest-busted to find
  parametric tests.

  [!WARNING] There was a bug in neovim 0.9.0 that was fixed in 0.9.2
  <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/24216> which shortened the output
  generated by lua scripts run using `nvim -l`. This is used internally to list
  all tests via busted for discovering parametric tests so if you experience
  issues, try upgrading.
`neotest-busted` supports parametric tests that are generated at runtime as
opposed to being defined entirely at source-level as shown below.
`describe`’s can also be parametric and are also supported.

Due to technical limitations, parametric tests won’t be shown in the neotest
summary until they have been run.

>lua
    describe("parametric tests", function()
        for i = 1, 3 do
            it(("test %d"):format(i), function()
                assert.are.same(i, i)
            end)
        end
    end)
<


DEBUGGING TESTS                               *neotest-busted-debugging-tests*

`neotest-busted` has support for debugging tests via
`local-lua-debugger-vscode`
<https://github.com/tomblind/local-lua-debugger-vscode> which can be set up via
`nvim-dap`
<https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation#lua>.
Once set up, you can set a breakpoint and run the test with the `dap` strategy.
Please refer to the `neotest` <https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest>
documentation for more information.


LUAROCKS AND BUSTED                       *neotest-busted-luarocks-and-busted*

Install luarocks from the website <https://luarocks.org/>. `neotest-busted`
will try to find a `busted` executable automatically at the different locations
listed below and in that priority (i.e. a directory-local install takes
precedence over a global install). You can check the installation by running
`luarocks list busted`.


  [!WARNING] If you have set `busted_command` to a non-nil value in the `setup`
  function, `neotest-busted` will not know where to look for appropriate lua
  paths and will not look for installations as specified below to avoid setting
  up paths for a different busted installation.
  In this case, you should set `busted_paths` and `busted_cpaths` to appropriate
  paths.

DIRECTORY-LOCAL INSTALL ~

You can install busted in your project’s directory by running the following
commands.

>shell
    > cd <your_project>
    > luarocks init
    > luarocks config --scope project lua_version 5.1
    > luarocks install busted
<


USER HOME DIRECTORY INSTALL ~


  [!IMPORTANT] You need to set `local_luarocks_only` to `false` for
  `neotest-busted` to find your home directory installation.
The following command will install busted in your home directory.

>shell
    > luarocks install --local busted
<


GLOBAL INSTALL ~


  [!IMPORTANT] You need to set `local_luarocks_only` to `false` for
  `neotest-busted` to find your global installation.
>shell
    > luarocks install busted
<


CONTRIBUTING                                     *neotest-busted-contributing*

FAQ                                                       *neotest-busted-faq*


Q: CAN I RUN ASYNC TESTS WITH NEOTEST-BUSTED?

Yes. Please see the instructions |neotest-busted-here|.

Busted removed support for async testing in version 2
<https://github.com/lunarmodules/busted/issues/545#issuecomment-282085568>
(even though the docs still mention it
<https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/#async-tests>) so you could install
busted v1 but I haven’t tested that.


Q: WHY IS NEOTEST-BUSTED TESTED USING PLENARY?

The test could be run via `neotest-busted` itself but I decided to use plenary
instead to use another test runner so that bugs in `neotest-busted` won’t
affect its own tests.
